# After Create App
Success! Created home at /Users/joe/gh/muheli/learn-react-01/home
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

- npm start
  - Starts the development server.

- npm run build
  - Bundles the app into static files for production.

- npm test
  - Starts the test runner.

- npm run eject
  - Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

- cd home
- npm start
